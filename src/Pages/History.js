              The Boeing 777, commonly referred to as the Triple Seven, is an
              American long-range wide-body airliner developed and manufactured
              by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the world's largest twinjet.
              The 777 was designed to bridge the gap between Boeing's other wide
              body airplanes, the twin-engined 767 and quad-engined 747, and to
              replace older DC-10s and L-1011 trijets.

                Developed in consultation with eight major airlines, with a
                first meeting in January 1990, the program was launched in
                October, with an order from United Airlines. The prototype was
                rolled out in April 1994, and first flew in June.

                Boeing delivered the first 777 to United Airlines on May 15,
                1995. The FAA awarded 180-minute ETOPS clearance for the Pratt &
                Whitney PW4084-engined aircraft on May 30, 1995, making it the
                first airliner to carry an ETOPS-180 rating at its entry into
                service. The first commercial flight took place on June 7, 1995,
                from London Heathrow Airport to Dulles International Airport
                near Washington, D.C. Longer ETOPS clearance of 207 minutes was
                approved in October 1996. <br /> <br /> On November 12, 1995,
                Boeing delivered the first model with General Electric GE90-77B
                engines to British Airways, which entered service five days
                later. Initial service was affected by gearbox bearing wear
                issues, which caused British Airways to temporarily withdraw its
                777 fleet from transatlantic service in 1997, returning to full
                service later that year. General Electric subsequently announced
                engine upgrades.

                The first model to emerge from the program, the 777-300ER, was
                launched with an order for ten aircraft from Air France, along
                with additional commitments. On February 24, 2003, the -300ER
                made its first flight, and the FAA and EASA certified the model
                on March 16, 2004. The first delivery to Air France took place
                on April 29, 2004. The -300ER, which combined the -300's added
                capacity with the -200ER's range, became the top-selling 777
                variant in the late 2000s

                The Boeing 777X is the latest series of the long-range,
                wide-body, twin-engine jetliners in the Boeing 777 family. The
                777X was launched in November 2013 with two variants: the 777-8
                and the 777-9. <br /> <br />The 777X program was proposed in the early 2010s
                with assembly at the Boeing Everett Factory and the wings built
                at a new building adjacent to the Everett factory. As of
                February 2023, there are 363 total orders for the 777X passenger
                and freighter versions from ten identified customers and other
                buyers. <br /> <br />In 2011, Boeing refined its response to the revamped
                Airbus A350 XWB with three 777X models, targeting a firm
                configuration in 2015, flying in late 2017 or 2018, and entering
                service by 2019.
